Welcome to Project Growler- your favorite (or at least, only) technical support for Techtoberfest.
We keep all of our database scripts under the db directory.
Our wepages are broken into a view/model approach under the web directory.
Other than that, checkout the java source files under the src directory.

We're still figuring this whole development thing out, so give us a moment to accustom ourselves to "proper" readme files and documentation.
